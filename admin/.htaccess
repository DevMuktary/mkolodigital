# --- Prevent Directory Listing ---
# This is the key security rule. It stops the server from showing a list of 
# files and results in a "403 Forbidden" error if someone visits /admin/.
Options -Indexes


# --- Security Enhancements ---
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    # Prevents your site from being placed in an iframe on another site (Clickjacking).
    Header always set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"

    # Prevents the browser from trying to guess file types, which can be a security risk.
    Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"

    # Enables the browser's built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter.
    Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
</IfModule>


# --- Protect Sensitive Files ---
# Block web access to files that should not be publicly visible.
<FilesMatch "\.(htaccess|htpasswd|ini|log|sh|inc|sql)$">
    Order Allow,Deny
    Deny from all
</FilesMatch>


# --- Performance: Enable Browser Caching ---
# Tells the browser to save copies of your files so the site loads faster on repeat visits.
